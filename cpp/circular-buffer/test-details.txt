/**************  requirements ******************/ 

The buffer will be 4 in size 
uint8_t type data can be put into the buffer 
uint8_t type data can be get from the buffer
The buffer should be FIFO in nature 
In the case of overfill, overwrite will occur
The buffer should be fixed sized 
User should know if buffer is empty
User should have the option to clear the buffer


/**************  Test Cases ******************/ 

clearing the buffer isEmpty should return true
Without putting anything isEmpty should return true. 
Without putting anything read will return -1 
Put ‘a’ in the buffer and read will return ‘a’ 
Put ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ in the buffer and read will return ‘a’
Put ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’ , ‘e’ in the buffer the and read will return ‘e’ , another read will return ‘b’ 
Put ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’ and read 5 times the last read will return -1 , put ‘e’, ‘f’, and read two times it should be ‘e’, ‘f’ 
Put ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’,  read 2 times , put ‘d’ read will return ‘c’ , put ‘e’ read will return ‘d’  
Put -1 to the buffer will return -1
